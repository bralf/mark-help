# mark-help

### Some python code and shell scripts to aid with Moodle/Engage preprocessing.

## Important files:

- preprocess.sh preprocesses the folder containing the submission folders and creates a file, partIDs.txt, which contains a list of all the participant IDs. It also creates a new folder, 2-Flat which is a flattened folder of all the submissions.
- make-mark-sheets.py, using partIDs.txt, creates an Excel workbook, grades.xlsx, which contains a template marking sheet and a copy of the template for each participant
- the folder 1-Unmarked currently contains some (fake) example submissions to show functionality.
- the spreadsheet master.csv currently is an example master sheet, corresponding to 1-Unmarked, to show functionality.

## Version 0.3 instructions:

1. Download submission folders and gradesheet (in csv format) from Moodle/Engage
2. Put the submission folders in a folder called â€œ1-Unmarked"
3. Run preprocess.sh
4. Make sure the parameters are correct in make-mark-sheet.py
5. Make sure the master csv file is names "master.csv"
5. Run make-mark-sheet.py
7. Mark!
8. Upload the master sheet (in .csv format) to Moodle/Engage

## TODO:

- Write a single .sh script which performs everything at once.
- Tweak endlessly...
